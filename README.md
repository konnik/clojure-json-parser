# Clojure JSON parser (from scratch)

Trying to wrap my head around Clojure by writing a simple
functional recursive descent JSON parser from scratch.

Beware, this is the first thing I'm coding in Clojure so it's 
probably not implemented in a very idiomatic way. It works though... 

Please also have look at my other JSON parsers written in
[Kotlin](https://github.com//konnik/kotlin-json-parser) and 
[Haskell](https://github.com//konnik/haskell-json-parser).

Happy parsing!
